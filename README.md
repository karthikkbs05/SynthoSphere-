# Design of APB Bridge based on AMBA AXI 4.0-

## Designing a APB to AXI Bridge which does Read operation where the Master uses AXI protocol and the Slaves use APB protocol-

Welcome to the documentation for the AXI to APB Bridge designed for enabling efficient read operations from APB slaves using the AXI protocol. This project focuses on creating a simplified bridge that facilitates read transactions from APB peripherals, offering enhanced understandability by utilizing a streamlined set of signals.

## Application of the Bridge-
* Protocol Integration: Bridges communication gaps between components using different protocols, such as connecting AXI and APB modules
* Software Development: Simplifies software coding when AXI processors interact with APB peripherals by abstracting protocol differences
* Interfacing Standard Peripherals: Enables AXI-based systems to connect with peripherals that support only the APB protocol
* Design Simplification: Reduces complexity by offering pre-designed solutions for protocol conversion
